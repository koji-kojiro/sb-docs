### Documentation
```
This is used by WRITE-STRING. It writes the string to the stream,
  optionally delimited by start and end, which default to 0 and NIL.
  The string argument is returned. The default method provided by
  FUNDAMENTAL-CHARACTER-OUTPUT-STREAM uses repeated calls to
  STREAM-WRITE-CHAR.
