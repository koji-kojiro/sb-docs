### Lambda list
```
(&BODY BODY)
```
### Documentation
```
Executes BODY with deferrable interrupts conditionally enabled. If there
are pending interrupts they take effect prior to executing BODY.

As interrupts are normally allowed WITH-INTERRUPTS only makes sense if there
is an outer WITHOUT-INTERRUPTS with a corresponding ALLOW-WITH-INTERRUPTS:
interrupts are not enabled if any outer WITHOUT-INTERRUPTS is not accompanied
by ALLOW-WITH-INTERRUPTS.
