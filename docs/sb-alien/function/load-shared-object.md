### Lambda list
```
(PATHNAME &KEY DONT-SAVE)
```
### Documentation
```
Load a shared library / dynamic shared object file / similar foreign
container specified by designated PATHNAME, such as a .so on an ELF platform.

Locating the shared object follows standard rules of the platform, consult the
manual page for dlopen(3) for details. Typically paths specified by
environment variables such as LD_LIBRARY_PATH are searched if the PATHNAME has
no directory, but on some systems (eg. Mac OS X) search may happen even if
PATHNAME is absolute. (On Windows LoadLibrary is used instead of dlopen(3).)

On non-Windows platforms calling LOAD-SHARED-OBJECT again with a PATHNAME
EQUAL to the designated pathname of a previous call will replace the old
definitions; if a symbol was previously referenced through the object and
is not present in the reloaded version an error will be signalled. Reloading
may not work as expected if user or library-code has called dlopen(3) on the
same shared object.

LOAD-SHARED-OBJECT interacts with SB-EXT:SAVE-LISP-AND-DIE:

1. If DONT-SAVE is true (default is NIL), the shared object will be dropped
when SAVE-LISP-AND-DIE is called -- otherwise shared objects are reloaded
automatically when a saved core starts up. Specifying DONT-SAVE can be useful
when the location of the shared object on startup is uncertain.

2. On most platforms references in compiled code to foreign symbols in shared
objects (such as those generated by DEFINE-ALIEN-ROUTINE) remain valid across
SAVE-LISP-AND-DIE. On those platforms where this is not supported, a WARNING
will be signalled when the core is saved -- this is orthogonal from DONT-SAVE.
