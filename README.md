An unofficial collection of API references of Steel Bank Common Lisp.

# Disclaimer
This is my **personal** project and very **experimentally**.
The documentations included in this repo are automatically extracted from documentation strings provided by SBCL,
so their rights are belongs to the original authors. Also note that this project is **unofficial** one.
SBCL has some architecture dependent APIs, so note that some of them may be different or not exist on your enviroment.
The documentations will be updated automatically by month, so target version of SBCL is always the newest one. If you want to refer the specific version, you can clone this repo and build by your hand, then you can use it locally.
